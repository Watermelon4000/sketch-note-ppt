## What is this?

**Sketch Notes PPT** is an AI skill that generates beautiful, self-contained HTML presentations in a distinctive **Sketch Notes** visual style — manga-inspired comic borders, speech bubbles, halftone patterns, and crosshatch textures.

Just tell any AI coding tool: *"Make a PPT about [topic]"* and get a complete `.html` file you can open in any browser. No npm, no build step, no dependencies.

> **Philosophy:** One idea per slide. One personality per deck.
